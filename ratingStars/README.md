## Rating Stars
In this folder HTML, JavaScript, and CSS are used to create a rating widget for customers to submit their rating for a specific product in an eComerce website. When hovering on a star, the stars with lower values will become grey and the one being hovered will have a black outline. If the star is selected, the stars greyed out and the selected star will become all black. There is an output section informing the user that their submission was successful and the rating will also be shown. There is also a part of the code that shows an example of posting user's rating to a REST endpoint. This section is commented out.
